The orcuScooter (short for "[Orcular](#%E2%84%B9%EF%B8%8F-about-the-orcular-project) Scooter") is an open-source kick scooter made from recycled plastics, aluminium and other parts. The main features are:
- Made from recycled plastics ([Precious Plastic](https://preciousplastic.com/) sheets)
- CNC milled parts
- 3D printed parts
- Circular design
  - Easy to repair & upgrade
  - Designed for disassembly
  - Most parts recyclebale
- [Open-source hardware](#-license)
- Designed in [FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org/) (open-source software)
  - CAD file accessible in this repository

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About the Orcular project
The orcuScooter is part of the Orcular project - https://www.orcular.org

"Orcular" stands for **O**pen Source + Ci**rcular** Economy

The project is about design concepts for locally recyclable products - for a constantly growing open source product library and the development of inner-city production.

Most components can be recycled into new parts - all within one city.
Recyclable plastic parts from the laser cutter, 3D printer and CNC mill, supplemented by standard parts.
