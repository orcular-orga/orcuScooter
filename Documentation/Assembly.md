# Assembly

## Part list

Please check the part list in the [BOM section](Shopping_list.md)

## Tool list

Check that you have all the tools you need:

- A set of screw drivers and wrenches for hexagon screws (M3, M5 and M8)
- A set of allen keys
- Pliers

## Assembling the frame

<table> <tr> <td> <img width="300" src="images/Assembly/001-A.png"> </td> <td> <ul>
        <li>Insert 2 t-nuts (M5) in one of the t-slot profiles (length 41 mm). You will need them later to assemble the brake.</li>
</table>

<table> <tr> <td> <img width="1500" src="images/Assembly/001b.png"> <br> <img width="1500" src="images/Assembly/004b.png"> <br> <img width="1500" src="images/Assembly/005.png"></td> <td> <ul>
        <li>Assamble the following 20x20 t-slot profiles:
          <ul>
            <li>length 509 mm (2 pieces)</li>
            <li>length 41 mm (2 pieces)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Use four 20x20 angles for mounting</li>
        <li>For each angle, you will need 2x M5 screws and 2x t-nuts</li>
        <li>Make sure to move the 41-mm-profiles to the right position (80 mm for the back part, 71 mm for the front part)</li>
        <li>Make sure to put the part with the 2 t-nuts (for the brake) in the back part of the frame (with a distance 80 mm)</li>
        <li>Make sure that the drilled holes are in the back</li>
        <li>Make sure that everything is parallel and at right angles</li>
        <li>Insert the M8 x 95 screw through the holes and make sure that it fits well</li>
        <li>Do not fasten the screw yet. If the screw fits, remove it again. The rear wheel will be mounted later.</li>
      </ul> </td> </tr> </table>

        <li>Insert 4x t-nuts (with M5 holes) in the frame (2 on each side)</li>
        <li>Insert them on the front part of the frame (where the distance of the profile is 71 mm and where are no holes)</li>
        <li>Mount the two angles using 2x M5 x 10 countersunk screws for each part</li>
        <li>Ensure that the angles are flush with the profiles</li>
        <li>Insert the M8 x 65 screw through the bigger hole and the bolt through the smaller hole and make sure everything fits well</li>

        <li>Insert the 3D-printed (nylon) plain bearing in the largest hole of the cross connection. It should sit tightly inside the hole.</li>
        <li>Mount the cross connection between the angles, using two 3D printed spacers (18 x 2,5 or 18 x 1,9) and a M8 x 65 screw with washers on each side (washers not shown in the image)</li>
        <li>Try the 18 x 2,5 spacers first. If they don't fit, try the 18 x 1,9 ones. If none of them fit, edit the file in FreeCAD or in a slicer software and print spacers that fit well. The cross connection part should not wobble</li>
        <li>Tighten the screw with a M8 nut (not shown in the image)</li>
        <li>Test the connection. The part should be rotatable.</li>
