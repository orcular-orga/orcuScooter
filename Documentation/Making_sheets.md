# Making sheets from recycled plastics

A recycled plastic sheet measuring 530 x 530 x 6 mm is required for the orcuScooter project (sheets with similar thicknesses like 5-7 mm should work, too).

For more information about how to make a recycled plastic with Precious Plastic machines, see the [instructions in the orcuDispenser documentation](https://github.com/orcular-org/orcuDispenser/blob/main/Documentation/Making_sheets.md)
